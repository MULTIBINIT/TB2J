Release Notes
=============

v0.3.5 November 3, 2020
-------------------------
Add --groupby option in wann2J.py to specify the order of the basis set in the hamiltonian.


v0.3.3 September 12, 2020
-------------------------
- Use collinear exchange calculator for siesta-collinear calculation, which is faster.

v0.3.2 September 12, 2020
-------------------------
- add --use_cache option to reduce the memory usage by storing the Hamiltonian 
    and eigenvectors on disk using memory map.


v0.3.1 September 3, 2020
-------------------------
- A bug in the sign of the magnetization along y in Wannier and OpenMX mode is fixed.


v0.3 August 31, 2020
------------------------
- A bug in calculation of anisotropic exchange is fixed.
- add TB2J_merge.py for merging DMI and anisotropic exchange from calculations 
  with different spin orientation or structure rotation.
- Improvement on output txt file.
- An interface to OpenMX (TB2J_OpenMX) is added in a separate github under GPLv3.
